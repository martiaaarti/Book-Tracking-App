# MyReads Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity Front-End Nanodegree build on top of the starter templete containing a static example what should be made interactive in React. This template was provided by Udacity. 

The application allows the user to search for books, select them and add to one of three categorized bookshelfs: currently reading, want to read and read.


## TL;DR

To get started you need to install Node.js and npm on your computer. Then:

* clone repository or download a zipped file
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
